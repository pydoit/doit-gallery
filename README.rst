Gallery of `doit` usages
========================

.. warning:: This is in experimental mode now

See, how others are using `doit`, show them how you do.

This is repository, where users may share with others their usage of `doit`.

**Usage is described by means of issue.**

.. note:: This is to share usage, **no code**, **no support**, **no discussion**.

    If you really want to express yourself in reaction to other issue, consider
    using emoticon or ask in discussion group.

Filling a gallery item
======================

- File an issue.
- Follow the template.
- Keep it simple and short. Showing `$ doit list`, `$ doit list --all` and possibly sample `$doit <command>` call can be enough.
- Save and come later if necessary.

Walking through gallery
=======================

- to be clarified. Open issues:
    - are completed items open or to be closed?
    - are we going to use some tagging? Some filters?
